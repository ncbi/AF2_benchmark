# Evaluation of Speach_AF applied to known fold-switching proteins

Sample_directory.tar.gz: Reference crystal structures used in the full analysis are available in the chains directory. Speach_AF example output for 1cee/ is available in the contact_sets directory.  set.py calculates TM-score and RMSD values between the reference structures and the structures produced by Speach_AF. The calculation is performed for the full chain length and the known fold-switching region to evaluate the accuracy of structures produced by Speach_AF.
